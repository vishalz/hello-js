# basic.60.objects

## Reference 
1. objects are passed around by reference 
1. objects are passed to functions by reference. 

## Object prototype
### Object prototype with Object.create

### All objects have a prototype and inherit properties from the prototype 
```
let s1 = { name : 'ryan' , email : 'ryan@gmail.com' , grade : '7' };
console.log ('s1');
console.log (Object.getPrototypeOf(s1));        // prints {}
console.log ('toString' in s1);                 // prints true inherited from object prototype
console.log ('name' in s1);                     // prints true

let s2 = Object.create(s1);
console.log ('s2');
console.log (Object.getPrototypeOf(s2) === s1); // prints true
console.log ('toString' in s2);                 // prints true inherited from object prototype
console.log ('name' in s2);                     // prints true inherited from s1
```






#### use Obect.create(null) to create an object w/o any prototype
```
let s3 = Object.create(null);
console.log ('s3');
console.log (Object.getPrototypeOf(s3));        // prints null
console.log ('toString' in s1);                 // prints false
console.log ('name' in s1);                     // prints false
```


### basic.60.objects -> Create objects with Object.create()

```
// Object.Create

let vehicle = {};
vehicle.make = 'Honda';
vehicle.model = 'Accord';
vehicle.year = 2010;
vehicle.sayHello = function sayHello(){
  console.log ("Hello");
};

console.log (Object.getPrototypeOf(vehicle) === null);

// Create v2 based on vehicle 
let v2 = Object.create(vehicle);
// v2 prototype will be = vehicle 
console.log (Object.getPrototypeOf(v2) === vehicle);

// v2 will get its own copy of properties
console.log (typeof v2);
console.log (v2.make);
console.log (v2.model);
console.log (v2.year);
v2.sayHello();

v2.make = 'BMW';
v2.model = 'X5';
v2.year = 1900;
console.log (v2.make); // prints 'BMW'
console.log (v2.model);// prints 'X5'
console.log (v2.year);// prints 1900

console.log (vehicle); // vehicle properties are not impacted

// deleting a property on v2 will not necessarily remove it as the prototype will have that property
delete v2.make;
console.log (v2.make);

```




## Use of Objects in Programming 
### objects can be used as collections of data. 
  1. This type of objects can be used to exchange data with other functions, programs or systems
  1. Example of this type of object is an object specifer whcih we will explore in basic.30
  1. Persist (store) data in a database 
### objects can be used to model objects in real world that have state and interface which allows other real objects to interact with them
  1. Example of real world scenario is user registration use case on amazon.com 
    1. As an amazon user I should be able to register (create an account) on amazon.com with my email, password and phone number
    1. As an amazon user I should be able to add my home address to my amazon account 
    1. As an amazon user I should be able to add my credit card to my amazon account
    1. As an amazon user I would to make sure that my account details are not accessible to any other user
    1. As an amazon administrator I should be able to make sure that users login before they can access their account
  1. To model this use case we can use an account object with following  methods
    1. account.register(userName,userEmail,userPhone,userPassword)
    1. account.addAddress(strAddress)
    1. account.getAddress()
    1. account.addCreditCard(strCreditCard)
    1. account.getCreditCard()
  1. The account will also need to store account details and make sure that these are private
    1. name of type string 
    1. email of type string 
    1. phone of type string 
    1. pasword of type string 
    1. address of type string 
    1. creditCard of type string 
  1. We also need to make sure that account access is only allowed to user who is the owner of the account.
    1. One way to do this is to have a login method that takes username and password as parameters
    1. If the login succeeds then the login methods returns a secret key. This is a random number
    1. A copy of secret key is stored as a object private property
    1. Now we need to make sure that any method that a has a valid secret key 
    1. The secret key has to be passed as a parameter on any method that access account details
    1. str secretkey = account.login(userName,userPassword);
    1. account object will validate 
    1. account.addAddress(strAddress,secretKey) 
    1. All methods that require access accounts 
    1. account.login(userEmail,userPassword)
    1. account.logout(userEmail);





## this 
1. Object methods that return properties are called getters
1. Object methods that update properties are called setters
1. Object methods can use this to access the properties of the object 

### Object methods can access object properties using this
1. Add getters to object and use this to return property valeus 
```
let vehicle   = {};
vehicle.make  = 'Honda';
vehicle.model = 'Accord';

vehicle.getMake = function(){
  let str = 'The make of this vehicle is ' + this.make; 
  return str;
}

vehicle.getModel = function(){
  let str = 'The model of this vehicle is ' + this.model; 
  return str;
}

console.log(vehicle.getMake());  // prints 'The make of this vehicle is Honda'
console.log(vehicle.getModel()); // prints 'The model of this vehicle is Accord'
```
## Object methods can update object properties using this
1. Object methods that update properties are called setters
1. Setters can validate values before they are assigned to properites
```
let vehicle   = {};
vehicle.make  = 'Honda';
vehicle.model = 'Accord';

vehicle.getModel = function(){
  let str = 'The model of this vehicle is ' + this.model;
  return str;
}

vehicle.setModel = function(strModel){
  if (typeof (strModel) !== 'string'){
    throw 'strModel is not of type string';              
  }

  this.model = strModel;                                  // set vehicle.model to strModel
}

console.log(vehicle.getModel());                          // prints 'The model of this vehicle is Accord'
vehicle.setModel('Civic');                                // sets vehcile.model to 'Civic'
console.log(vehicle.getModel());                          // prints 'The model of this vehicle is Civic'
```

## Objects can be frozen 

## Copying Objects
1. Copying objects, Use  Object.assign()  syntax to make a copy of an array 




## Reflection and Enumeration
## hasOwnProperty

### Access object properties 
### Loop through all elements of object using for loop 

## Finding values in objects

## Encapsulation
1. Object properties can be set with invalid values 
1. For some Objects it is desirbale to hide these properties
1. Hidden properites can only be accessed by the getter/setter methods of the Object
1. To make poperties private, declare them as variables in object maker function  

```
let makeVehicle = function(make,model){

  // hidden properites
  // make and mode are declared as variable of function makeVehicle
  // only available to blocks and functions inside makeVehicle function

  let make  = make;  // make of the vehicle string
  let model = model; // mode of the vehicle string

	let vehicle = {};    // create the vehicle object
  
  // Add getter methods to object vehicle
  vehicle.getMake = function(){
	  return  make; 
	}
  vehicle.getModel = function(){
	  return  model;
	}

  //Add setter methods to object vehcile
	
  vehicle.setModel = function(strModel){
	 if (typeof (strModel) !== 'string') { throw 'strModel is not a string'; }
   model = strModel;
	}

  return Object.freeze(vehicle); // freeze the object and return it

}// end of function makeVehicle


let myCar  = makeVehicle('Ford','Focus');     // create the myCar Object using makeVehicle function
console.log (typeof (myCar));   // prints object
console.log (myCar.make) ;      // prints undefined
myCar.model = 1234;          // silent fail. the object is frozen cannot add any properties
console.log(myCar.model);        // prints undefined
console.log (myCar.getMake());  // prints 'Ford';
console.log (myCar.getModel()); // prints 'Focus';
myCar.setModel('Accord');       // set the model using object methods
console.log (myCar.getMake());  // prints 'Honda';
console.log (myCar.getModel()); // prints 'Accord';
```


# basic.60.control
## Throwing Errors 
1. Use throw statement to generte an exception from your function 
1. The function will return, statements after throw will not executed
1. Control will be returned to the first catch block in the call stack
1. Exceptions can be generated using string , boolean , numbers or object types 

```
  // incremento
	let incremento = function (x){
    //Several ways to specify what type is used to throw the error
    if (typeof(x) !== 'number'){
      let err = "x is not a number";            //  throw a string
      throw (err);
	  }

    if (isNaN(x)){
      let err = new Error('x is a NaN');        // throw an error object using new
      throw (err);
    }

	  if (!isFinite(x)){
      let err = Object.create(Error.prototype); //  throw an error object using Object.create
      err.message = "x is not Finite";
      throw (err);
    }

	  ++x;
	  return x;
	
  }//end of incremento

```





# basic.60.arrays 

## Convert Arrays to Strings 
1.  Use Array.join() to convert Array to String
  1. Join all elements of  Array w/o any characters in between them. Pass empty string "" as a separater 
  1. Join will ignore undefiend, null values , empty strings and holes, 
  1. Join will not ignore  false, 0 and NaN
		```
		var a = [1,2,undefined,null,'', ,"3"]; // a is an array with holes and undefined values
		console.log (a.length)                 // prints i7
		var b = a.join("");                    // Pass empty string as a separater argument
		console.log (b);                       // prints '123'
		console.log (b.length);                // prints 3
		```
		```
		var a = [1,2,undefined,null,'', ,"3"]; // a is an array with holes and undefined values
		console.log (a.length)                 // prints i7
		var b = a.join("");                    // Pass empty string as a separater argument
		console.log (b);                       // prints '123'
		console.log (b.length);                // prints 3
  	```
		

# basic.60.types

## Name 
  1. A name is a letter optinally followed by one or more numbers, letters or underbars. 
  1. A name can not be a JS reserved word 
  1. names are used for
    1. variables
    1. parameters
    1. property names
    1. statements
    1. operators
    1. labels

## Numbers
  1. JavaScript has a single number type internally repesented as a 64 bit floating point
  1. 1 = 1.0 
  1. 100 = 1e2 
  1. There is no integer type 
  1. NaN is a number value 
  1. NaN is not equal to any value including itself
  1. Detect NaN with isNaN(number) function
  1. Numbers have methods
    1. number.toExponential(fractionDigits)
    1. number.toFixed(fractionDigits)
    1. number.toPrecision(precision)
    1. number.toString(radix)

## Statements
  1. A compilation unit consists of a set of executable statements 
  1. Statements tend to be executed in order from top to bottom. 
  1. The sequence of execution can be altered by 
    1. conditional statements (if and switch), 
    1. looping statements (while, for, and do), 
    1. disruptive statements (break, return, and throw),
    1. function invocation. 
  
### var statement
  1. When used inside a function defines the functions private variables

### if statement
  1. if (expression){ ... } else { ... };
  1. if statement changes the flow of the program based on the value of  expression
  1. if expression is falsy the else block is executed.

### while statement
  1. while (expression) {... } ; 
  1. while expression is truthy the block will be executed

## Expressions

### The simplest expressions are
  1. A literal value (string or number)
  1. A variable 
  1. A built in value 
  1. An invoation expression 
  1. 

### Inovocation Operator 
  1. Invoation operator casues the execution of a function value
  1. Invocation operator is a  pair of parenthesis  that follow function value 
  1. (expression)
  1. The parentheses can contain arguments that will be delivered to the function

### Refinement operator 
  1. A refinement is used to specify a property or element of an object or array.
  1. .name or [expresssion]

### Prefix Operators
  1. typeof
  1. unary plus or tonumber  +
  1. unary -  
  1. Logical not !

### Infix Operators

  1. greater or equal >= 
  1. less or equal <=
  1. greater >
  1. less <
  1. equal ===
  1. not equal !==
  1. logical or || 
  1. logical and &&






## Literals
### Types of Literals -> Literal is a convenient notation of speccifying a type
    1. number literal 
    1. string literal 
    1. object literal 
    1. array literal 
    1. function literal 
    1. regexp literal

### Object Literal
    1. Pair of curly braces surrounding zero or more name/valaue pairs



  1. Function Objects are linked to Function.prototype, which is linked to Object.prototype
  1. Every function has two more hidden propertoes 
          1. Function's Context 
          1. Code that implements function's behaviour 
  1. prototype property
   *      Every functions object is also created with a prototype property. 
   *      The value of the prototype property is an object with a constructor property whose value is the function.
   *      This is not the same as the hidden link to the Function.prototype
